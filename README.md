TouchstoneJS Starter
====================

Reference TouchstoneJS App with examples of all UI components.

**See the demo [live here](https://touchstonejs.github.io/touchstonejs-starter/)**.

To build and preview locally, run the `gulp dev` task. It will build the app with browserify, and start a preview server at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

The source for the app is in the `/src` folder; `/www` and `/platforms` are managed by cordova.

To build for iOS, run `gulp prepare` then build the XCode project `/platforms/ios/Touchstone`.

More documentation and examples to come soon.
