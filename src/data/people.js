But done properly, this architecture can be used to implement real-time, multi-user shared state between many users of the same web applications. Using HTTP requests to dispatch stores, and Websocket to broadcast updates, Flux over the Wire has the potential to trivialize several hard problems. While the idea of using Websockets to back Flux is rather straightforward, doing it in a way that scales up to tens of thousands of concurrent viewers can prove challenging. In addition, Flux over the Wire offers an interface which considerably eases server-side rendering, as it completely abstracts data fetching and data syncing from the React views that tap into its stores and dispatch its actions.</p>\n",

Next, we&#39;ll look at how React and Flux approaches can help in our problem scenarios.

Finally, we&#39;ll look at new approaches we’ve been exploring, and how designs like decoupling &#39;recording facts&#39; from &#39;computing views of those facts&#39; have influenced UI engineering.

When is it best to use each?\n    We&#39;ve heard a lot about pure components, but how do we make pure\n    components when we have to deal with the realities of a stateful\n    world? How do we make more complex components whose props actually\n    represent them?\n    We&#39;ll cover how we&#39;ve answered these questions at Khan Academy,\n    including techniques and patterns to make dealing with large pure\n    components simpler, as well as current open questions.</p>\n",

Although there&#39;s also react-art, react-three, react-canvas, react-curses... Oh, and react-native! Even if you bottom out at HTML, most of what React does really well is rendering to OTHER React components. Meanwhile most projects still try to retrofit our needs into HTML and CSS primitives. I&#39;ll talk about why the DOM is flawed and how it is becoming a second-class citizen in the land of React apps.</p>\n",
